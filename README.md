# project_1 (LTA Traffic Data)

This is a small representation of the transport coverage in Singapore,
meant to highlight areas served by public transport and useful information
such as bus arrival timings and traffic incidents. I do have some features I would
like to add in future if able, such as bus routes, that would fully show the "coverage"
intended in this project.

Data provided by: https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html
API access key granted upon registration and following the documentation.

Special thanks to the respective communities of the open-source tools/plugins/resources used:

- Leaflet
- Axios
- Bootstrap
- helpful people online (Google, StackOverflow, Chappie, etc.)

You guys/gals rock! I do hope I will be able to contribute back in some way/shape/form
for this generosity in future.
Last but not least, thank you Mr. T for the proxy! I would have had to switch to something which was not my first choice for this project if not for your aid.

Do take a look at the project here: https://anonuserhere.github.io/
